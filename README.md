# AIKnowledgeCMS

AIKnowledgeCMS is a self-growing CMS that automatically collects, filters, and organizes domain-specific information into a long-term knowledge base.

It is designed to accumulate **understanding**, not to publish transient content.

---

## Why

Most CMS platforms are optimized for publishing, SEO, or frequent manual updates.

AIKnowledgeCMS takes a different approach:

- Learning happens continuously
- Knowledge should compound over time
- Manual posting should not be required to keep a site alive

This project exists to support **quiet, consistent knowledge accumulation** driven by personal or team interests.

---

## What AIKnowledgeCMS Does

- Automatically collects information from predefined, trusted sources
- Filters and categorizes content using AI-assisted logic
- Stores information as structured knowledge rather than short-lived posts
- Grows continuously without manual content creation

The result is a CMS that evolves naturally alongside your learning process.

---

## Core Components

AIKnowledgeCMS is intentionally split into lightweight, role-specific components.

- `aiknowledgecms.php`  
  Handles CMS-level responsibilities such as data storage, structure, and presentation.

- `aiknowledgecms.py`  
  Provides AI-assisted processing for analysis, transformation, and knowledge structuring.

- `news2audio.py`  
  Converts accumulated knowledge or news sources into audio-ready scripts, enabling downstream media usage.

This separation allows the system to evolve without tightly coupling knowledge storage and media execution.

---

## What AIKnowledgeCMS Is NOT

- Not a news aggregator
- Not an AI content generator for SEO
- Not a social media automation tool
- Not designed for virality or content volume

AIKnowledgeCMS prioritizes relevance, continuity, and clarity over reach.

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Personal knowledge bases
- Long-term research tracking
- Domain-focused learning archives
- Small teams managing shared understanding

The system is best suited for environments where **thinking long-term matters more than posting often**.

---

## Project Philosophy

AIKnowledgeCMS follows a simple order:

1. Learn for yourself  
2. Organize what matters  
3. Let knowledge accumulate naturally  

Any outward sharing (text, audio, or social formats) should be a **byproduct**, not the goal.

---

## Relationship to Other Projects

AIKnowledgeCMS can function independently, but is designed to integrate naturally with other media layers such as:

- AIRadio
- Script-based audio or video generation pipelines

By keeping knowledge accumulation separate from media execution, the system remains stable, reusable, and adaptable.

---

## Status

This project is actively used in a real environment and continues to evolve.

Initial releases focus on core CMS functionality.  
Media-related integrations are intentionally kept modular and optional.
